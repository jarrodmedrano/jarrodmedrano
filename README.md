# Hi there 👋
Here's my BS intro written by Chat GPT: Hello! I'm Jarrod and I'm a web developer specializing in front-end development with a focus on React. With a solid foundation in current front-end technologies, I bring expertise in building engaging and responsive web applications. I'm super into crafting intuitive user experiences and leveraging the power of React & Next JS to create dynamic and interactive interfaces. Constantly seeking to learn and grow, I stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in front-end development to deliver high-quality and performant solutions. Let's collaborate and create amazing web experiences together!

In all seriousness though, I love learning about web development as you can see from my git history.

## 📝 I’m currently using and learning:
- 🌎 Terraform with AWS
- 🪓 Next JS with TRPC
- 🐳 Docker
- 🦀 Rust (when time permits)
